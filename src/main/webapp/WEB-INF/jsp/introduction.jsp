							Introduction
						</h2>
						<p>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Research
								on rice, to support breeding of new varieties with more yields
								in more stress condition, is one of the main scientific
								priorities identified by the Vietnamese government. Global
								climatic change and its impact on water availability and
								temperature increase is expected to affect drastically rice
								culture in Vietnam both in mountainous and central plateau areas
								(drought stress), and in low lands and deltas (water deficit,
								salt contamination). This is also expected to have an impact on
								the distribution of the zones contaminated by viruses (via the
								expansion of their insect vectors promoted by temperature
								changes) and nematodes (linked to water deficit). </font>
						</p>
						<div>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It
								is in this context that the Institute of Genetic Agronomy of
								Hanoi (IAG), belonging to the Vietnam Academy of Agricultural
								Science (VAAS) in association with the&nbsp;Joint Research
								Unit&nbsp;Diversité, Adaptation et Développement des Plantes
								(UMR DIADE, IRD/UM2) and the University of Science and
								Technology of Hanoi (USTH) have created&nbsp;this International
								Joint Laboratory&nbsp;focused on Rice Functional Genomics and
								Plant Biotechnology (LMI RICE).</font>

							Objectives
						</h2>
						<h3>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research</span>
						</h3>
						<div>
							The core research activity of the
								LMI RICE&nbsp;will be to study and to decipher fundamental
								mechanisms related to the development of rice (panicle and root
								branching in regard to yield and water deficit / salt tolerance,
								respectively) and to its resistance against pathogens (virus and
								nematodes)						</div>
						<h3>
							</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hosting
								platform</span>
						</h3>
						<div>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
								addition to this activity in rice functional genomics, the
								objective of the LMI RICE&nbsp;will be to develop a plant
								functional genomics and biotechnology open platform to promote
								the emergence and the realization of new collaborative projects
								on plant biotechnology. One of this project&nbsp;is planed to
								be&nbsp;focused on the actinorhizal trees Casuarina that
								contribute to protect coastal areas in Vietnam.
						</div>
						<h3>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Education
						</h3>
						<div>
							<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The&nbsp;development
								of the LMI RICE&nbsp;is associated with the creation of the new
								French / Vietnamese University of Sciences and Technology of
								Hanoi (USTH) and peaple involved in the LMI RICE will contribute
								to teaching activities in the Master Degree "Biotechnology and
								Pharmacology" speciality Plant Biotechnology of the USTH but
								also in VAAS, Hanoi University of Agronomy, Hanoi University of
								Forestry...
